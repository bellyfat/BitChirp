http(s)://BitChirp.org uses the Bitmessage API. Bitmessage allows for secure, anonymous (to a large extent) posting of “Tweets”. It’s still a work in progress, be sure to check out Bitmessage.org and Bitmessage.org/forum for more details. The front-end uses the Foundation responsive framework. The midde-to-back-end uses PHP-MySQL and Python.
